# Jeopardy App

The "Get Question" button will make a GET request (using fetch) to get random trivia data using the URL: http://jservice.io/api/random

Made some html elements like a div where you will display the question, category and points. 

Made another div in HTML where the answer will display.

Added an on click, that has a function that will toggle whether or not you can see the answer.

Added other elements to the page to make it make sense and look good.

Made a div that has an h2 and two buttons

Inside the h2 I keep the score, started at 0.

Made one button added the points to the score and the other to subtract points from the score, added a little style and color to the app.
